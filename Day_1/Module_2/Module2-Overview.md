  *10 minutes*   Introducing key concepts                      An important part of working with data is assessment. Understanding the importance of assessment and using data from your assessment is key to using data in decision making.
                                                               
                                                               To begin, write the word assessment on the board. Ask the class if they have a definition in mind for this word. Then, provide the following definition:
                                                               
                                                               To assess something means to determine its merit, worth, or significance. At its most basic level, assessment answers the question: did it work? (Adapted from *Essentials of Utilization-Focused Evaluation, Patton.)*
                                                               
                                                               For organizational purposes, assessment describes critically looking at a program or policy by understanding the purpose of that program, what happened that was intended as a result of that program, how the program was implement, and what outcomes were achieved. Then, that information and data that were collected during the process can be turned into items for future action or recommendations.
                                                               
                                                               Assessment answers the following questions:
                                                               
                                                               -   What?
                                                               
                                                               > What happens in the program? What services and experiences can the program offer? What outcomes and impacts result from the program? What happened that we didn’t anticipate?
                                                               
                                                               -   So what?
                                                               
                                                               > What do the findings mean? Why did the program results happen? What judgements can be made? Can we decide if the program was a success or failure?
                                                               
                                                               -   Now what?
                                                               
                                                               > What can we do with this information? What recommendations can we make? What improvements should be made?

  *25 minutes*   Providing Context                             Tell the participants that assessment is something that we do in our everyday lives.
                                                               
                                                               Solicit the following responses:
                                                               
                                                               -   What do the participants think makes a good football match?
                                                               
                                                               -   What do the participants think makes a good student?
                                                               
                                                               -   What do the participants think makes a good meal?
                                                               
                                                               Many people have different perspectives on what they perceive to be good or bad, and assess things on a daily basis. When you asked the participants about their opinions on what makes up a good quality of something, you are assessing what concepts, ideas, or values are important.
                                                               
                                                               Provide the participants with one of the following two examples:
                                                               
                                                               1)  Generic Example: A nonprofit in Uganda wanted to build a chicken coup and sell the eggs and chickens as a profit. However, once they built it, none of the chickens produced any eggs. When the chickens did not produce eggs, they asked themselves why did this happen? They then interviewed poultry experts in East Africa and found that the building they constructed for the chickens was too hot for them to lay any eggs. They used this information to draw a recommendation that the next building they build for the chickens should be structured to be cool enough for the chickens to lay eggs.
                                                               
                                                               2)  Myanmar Specific Example: New Yangon Bus System (2017). Political and economic liberalization since 2010 has seen unprecedented population growth and activity in the nation’s largest city, Yangon. As a result, traffic congestion has increasingly become a major concern. In January of 2017, the NLD regional government reconfigured the city’s bus system, the primary means of transportation for the majority of the city’s population. They condensed the approximately 350 operating bus lines and over 4000 privately owned busses into a mere 71 lines and approximately 2000 busses. The idea was to improve congestion, safety, and environmental concerns; however, the first day of the new system in January was anything but improvement. Many individuals had to wait significantly longer for busses as many were full when they arrived at their bus stop. Many also discovered that their commute time increased significantly due to overcrowding and multiple transfers. In response, the Yangon regional government has been conducting surveys and studies on the faults and difficulties of the new bus system for the public. They found that they did not have enough busses for the public, people are unfamiliar with the routes, and many of the new routes are not as direct for passengers, resulting in longer commute times and multiple transfers. Although many changes have yet to occur as of May 2017, there is increasingly public and political demand on the Yangon regional government to address these concerns and representatives from the regional government emphasize that they are making plans and drafting proposals to make changes based on survey data and public demand.

                                                               Apply the assessment cycle to the chicken coup story or the example of the bus system in Yangon.

                                                               -   Do (build the chicken coup) (reconfigure the bus system)
                                                               
                                                               -   Review (what happened)
                                                               
                                                               -   Assess (why did it happen)
                                                               
                                                               Now, put the participants in groups of 2-3. Ask them to think of a time where they thought they had a good idea, but in practice the good idea they had failed. Have them share their experience with each other. This does not have to be organization specific, but can be related to their everyday lives. If the struggle to think of a situation, provide some context. Is there an idea that they had like the chicken coup in Uganda or the new bus system in Yangon that failed in real life?
                                                               
                                                               When the participants are finished, ask for volunteers to share with the class. After each presentation is finished, apply the scenario to the assessment cycle.
                                                               
                                                               When the presentation is finished, have discussion with the participants. Underscore the importance of using assessment for data driven decision making. Some guiding questions to ask include: Why is assessment important? How can you use assessment to collect data? How can that data you collected in the assessment be used for decision making?

  *10 minutes*   Understanding Key concepts                    In assessing you own organizations, it is important to keep the vision and mission of your organization in mind. Ask the participants if they have heard of a vision/mission statement before. Then, provide the following definition (Adapted from *Establishing Your Vision, Mission, and Strategy.* Marshall Strategy, 2012):
                                                               
                                                               Vision statement: a postcard for how your organization sees the future.
                                                               
                                                               Mission statement: the role you want your organization to play in that future.
                                                               
                                                               As an analogy, provide the following image:

                                                               Pass the image around or project it on the screen. Tell the participants that they can imagine their organization’s vision as the city they see in the picture. An organization’s mission is the path that they will take and the tools that they will use to get to that vision.
                                                               
                                                               For context, provide the following examples of mission/vision statements for organizations they might be familiar with. Feel free to use the generic examples, but if implementing this workshop in Myanmar, provide your own, locally specific examples for participants. Project these images on the screen or write them on the board.
                                                               
                                                               Generic Example: IBM
                                                               
                                                               Vision: A smarter planet.
                                                               
                                                               Mission: To invent, develop, and manufacture the most advanced information and technologies.
                                                               
                                                               Take time to discuss the mission with the participants. Some guiding questions include: how does IBM’s mission help them reach their vision? What tools will they use?
                                                               
                                                               Generic Example: BRAC
                                                               
                                                               Vision: A world free from all forms of exploitation and discrimination where everyone has the opportunity to realize their potential.
                                                               
                                                               Mission: Our mission is to empower people and communities in situations of poverty, illiteracy, disease, and social injustice.
                                                               
                                                               Take time to discuss the mission with the participants. Some guiding questions include: how does BRAC’s mission help them reach their vision? What tools will they use?
                                                               
                                                               Locally specific (Myanmar): MBAPF (Myanmar Book Aid and Preservation Foundation)
                                                               
                                                               Vision: To have a strong knowledge based society in Myanmar through libraries by transforming community libraries into community centres.
                                                               
                                                               Mission: To provide resources to build the capacity of libraries in Myanmar by bringing global library trends to Myanmar.

  *25 minutes*   Application                                   Put the class into groups of 2-3 and ask them to create their own vision/mission statements for their organization. Remind them to think of their vision statements as how they see the future that their organization helped build, and the mission as the path that they will take to get there.
                                                               
                                                               Some other guiding questions in crafting a mission statement include:
                                                               
                                                               -   What is our cause?
                                                               
                                                               -   What are our actions? What do we do? What do we provide?
                                                               
                                                               -   What is our impact? Is it health? Stronger communities? Security? Opportunity?
                                                               
                                                               Have the participants write down their vision/mission statements in groups, and then ask for volunteers to share with the class. After each presentation, take time to ask others in the class how their vision/mission statement follows the picture analogy of the city and the road to get to the city.
                                                               
                                                               Debrief with the participants about why knowing your organization’s vision and mission statement is important in understanding your organization’s data culture, and how it can help you in data for decision making. Some guiding questions include: Why do you need to know your organization’s vision/mission in order to make informed, data driven decisions about programming? How will knowing your organization’s mission/vision help you make these decisions? How can the vision/mission guide your organization in conducting assessments?

  *15 minutes*   Linking assessment and stakeholder analysis   Review the term “stakeholders”. Ask the participants for a definition, the remind them:
                                                               
                                                               Stakeholders: a person with an interest or concern in something. For example, who are the stakeholders in this class? Who are the stakeholders at a restaurant? Who are the stakeholders at a football match?
                                                               
                                                               Defining a problem in which to use data to make a decision is a crucial first step in data for decision-making. Another important piece of data for decision-making is understanding who your stakeholders are by performing a stakeholder analysis. Understanding all the actors and their relative influence over the problem will help you frame your plans within the existing government, civil society, academic, and other systems responsible for addressing a problem.
                                                               
                                                               When you think about your stakeholders, you should consider:
                                                               
                                                               -   Communities, the people who experience the problem directly, and interact with problem solvers.
                                                               
                                                               -   Problem Solvers, the civil servants, NGO staff, front-lone responders, and others on-the-ground.
                                                               
                                                               -   Policymakers: the people who have access to resources and control allocation. (UNDP, Big Data Guide, 2016)
                                                               
                                                               Here, a locally specific policy example would be helpful. If implementing this program in Myanmar, please feel free to use the below example.
                                                               
                                                               In 2015, Myanmar experienced severe flooding in many regions from heavy rainfall. The communities in this situation are the villages and populations affected by the flooding. The problem solvers are the aid and relief workers assisting affected populations. The policymakers are mainly government officials and elected members of parliament.
                                                               
                                                               Next, walk the class through who the stakeholders in the issue are. Some guiding questions: who are the communities? Who are the problem solvers? Who are the policy makers?
                                                               
                                                               For each stakeholder, think through:
                                                               
                                                               -   What is their influence over the problem? Underscore to participants that some stakeholders may not have influence over the problem.
                                                               
                                                               -   What is their influence over the project?
                                                               
                                                               -   How do data support this person’s decision-making power?
                                                               
                                                               -   What could this person do with better data on the problem?
                                                               
                                                               Before moving on, take the time to provide some space for discussion in order to link the key concepts of assessment, mission/vision, and stakeholder analysis together. Some guiding discussion questions include: How can knowing your organization’s mission/vision help guide your assessment process? How can conducting a stakeholder analysis help your assessment? How can frame your stakeholder analysis and assessments through the mission or your organization inform how you will use the results to make decisions?
                                                               
                                                               After discussion, dismiss the class for a ten-minute break.

**Time Action Instructor Notes**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *15 minutes*   Introducing key concepts   Welcome the class back and pause to answer any questions. Then, write “data producer” and “data consumer” on the board if possible, or display them on the projector.
                                            
                                            Underline the word “producer”. Ask the class what this word means. If the class is silent, feel free the guide them with the following questions: who makes the clothes they are wearing? Who cooks the meals in their household? Who makes their cellphone? These people are all producers.
                                            
                                            Then underline the word “consumer”. Ask the class what this word means. Again, if participants are slow to respond, guide them along by using the same examples. In the clothing example, who is wearing them? Who eats the meal that was cooked? Who uses the cellphone? These people are consumers.
                                            
                                            Then, connect this back to data for decision making. State that much like in any marketplace, there are producers (those that make a good) and consumers (those that use the good). Offer the following definitions:
                                            
                                            -   Data producer: A user, interface, system, or device that collects data that’s relevant an organization.
                                            
                                            -   Data consumer: A user interface, system, or tool that uses the data.
                                            
                                            Ask the class whether their organization is a data consumer or producer. Ask for volunteers to explain how their organization produces or consumes data.
                                            
                                            For the participants whose organizations are data producers, ask them why they collect data? What can the data be used for? Who would want to use your data?
                                            
                                            For the participants whose organizations are data consumers, ask them why they use the data produced by the producing organizations? What are they using that data for? Who else might want that data?
                                            
                                            []{#_gjdgxs .anchor}
                                            
                                            Take the time to go over potential sources of data for the participants. A list can be found in Appendix 1 of this document, but also try to solicit response from participants of several examples before providing the list for the participants.
                                            
                                            Then, ask the participants what resources they might need in collecting or consuming data. Do they need human skills? Technology? The help of a decision-making authority?
                                            
                                            Finally, ask both the producers and consumers in the class what decisions they can make using the data that’s available to them at their organization. If the class is quiet, go back to some previous examples the participants offered. Some guiding questions include: How could that data be used to solve a problem? How could you use data available to you to make an internal decision at the organization? How could you use that data to make an external decision?

  *25 minutes*   Activity 2.1               Revisiting your organization’s data culture through a critical incident
                                            
                                            See the annotated instructor guide for Activity 2.1 for more information.

  *10 minutes*   Sharing data               After the activity, take time to underscore to the participants the importance of self-reflection around data. Why do they think it is important to use self-reflection on evidence from critical incidents in their organization?
                                            
                                            Then, communicate to the participants that, just as self-reflection in their own organization is important, so are sharing these lessons learned from your organization with other organizations. This allows you to learn from each other’s successes and failures. Ask the participants, why might this be important?
                                            
                                            This is a process known as knowledge sharing. Write the words “knowledge sharing” on the board or project them on the screen. Ask the participants what they think this means. Then, offer the following definition:
                                            
                                            Knowledge sharing: an activity through which information, skills, expertise is exchanged between people, friends, and organizations. (Bulchandani, Linkedin, 2015)
                                            
                                            Emphasize to the class that knowledge sharing helps create awareness among different organizations, helps facilitate faster solutions and improves response rates, can increase coordination, and can also provide ways for new ideas to be accepted and shared faster.
                                            
                                            Engaging with other organizations allows them to learn from each other. You can share approaches, methods, tools, or instruments with each other. You should try to be as open as possible about sharing your data, your analysis, and your conclusions from that analysis.
                                            
                                            Ask the participants, do they share knowledge in their everyday life? How does that impact the people around them? Does it help those people succeed? Then, link this back to their organization. Ask the class, how might one organization’s findings help others? If they are quiet or slow to provide a response, feel free to draw from the examples used in activity 2.1. How can the lessons learned from one organization help another?
                                            
                                            Remind the participants that it’s natural to be nervous sharing data. Criticism will come. But it’s important to move beyond that and realize the gains that you can make in sharing data.

  *25 minutes*   Activity 2.2               Learning to share resources
                                            
                                            See the annotated instructor guide for Activity 2.2 for more information.

  *5 minutes*    Debrief                    Review that today the class learned about the importance of assessment, understanding their organization’s mission/vision, how data are used in their organization, and the importance of sharing data. Remind the class of the following process of using data for decision making:
                                            
                                            1)  Identifying a problem or research question
                                            
                                            2)  Assessing data available to you and your data needs
                                            
                                            3)  Identify stakeholders
                                            
                                            4)  Plan for data will be used, analyzed, and shared.
                                            
                                            State that number 4 will be part of tomorrow’s lesson. Then, ask the class that for homework each participant think of one dataset, table, or data visualization that they have at their own organization and can bring into class tomorrow.
                                            
                                            Take time to answer any questions, and then dismiss the class for the day.
