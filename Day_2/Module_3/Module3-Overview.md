  *15 minutes*   Review                                     Welcome the participants back. Remind the participants of the structure for today: two, three-hour workshops with a break in between for lunch. Also use this time to go over any administrative tasks as necessary.
                                                            
                                                            Then, review the following key concepts with the participants. Again, as before, try to have the participants provide their own definitions before

                                                            -   Data consumer
                                                            
                                                            Ask, what are the key steps to using data for decision making? Remind the participants:
                                                            
                                                            -   Identify a problem or research question
                                                            
                                                            -   Assess data available to you and your data needs
                                                            
                                                            -   Identify stakeholders
                                                            
                                                            -   Plan for how data will be used, analyze, and shared
                                                            
                                                            Pause to ask if anyone has questions so far.

  *15 minutes*   Introducing key concepts: data lifecycle   Write the word “lifecycle” on the board or project it on the screen. Ask the class what they think the word means. Where have they seen this word before? What kind of examples of lifecycles can they provide? If the class is quiet or slow to respond, feel free to provide some guiding questions, such as what is an example of a lifecycle within their own life? An animal’s life? A plant’s life?
                                                            
                                                            Tell the class that much like living things, data has a lifecycle of its own.
                                                            
                                                            Project this image on the screen, or pass it around to participants.
                                                            
                                                            ![4D-LinearModel.jpg](media/image3.jpg){width="4.181590113735783in" height="1.474278215223097in"}
                                                            
                                                            Then, tell the class that this image represents a data life cycle. There are three stages:
                                                            
                                                            -   Collecting data
                                                            
                                                            -   Analyzing data
                                                            
                                                            -   Sharing data
                                                            
                                                            Remind the class that any data lifecycle always begins with a research question or problem that you are trying to solve.
                                                            
                                                            Then, move on to the following definitions. As before, solicit the class for their own definitions before providing them with the ones below.
                                                            
                                                            -   Collecting data: data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information from a variety of sources to get a complete and accurate picture of an area of interest. *(Rouse, TechTagret)*
                                                            
                                                            Remind the class that data can be collected from surveys, questionnaires, interviews, or observations.
                                                            
                                                            -   Analyzing data: data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and visualizing data with the goal of discovering its useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision making. *(Exploring Data Analysis, 2017)*
                                                            
                                                            Take time to explain to the participants that data analysis is made up of many stages:
                                                            
                                                            -   Inspecting the data
                                                            
                                                            -   Cleaning the data
                                                            
                                                            -   Transforming the data
                                                            
                                                            -   Visualizing the data (visually)
                                                            
                                                            Introduce the above concepts, but make note that will be explained in detail in the next module. Then, provide the definition for the last part of the data lifecycle:
                                                            
                                                            -   Sharing data: data sharing is the process of making data used to answer a question or solve a problem available to other investigators. (*Savage, 2009)*
                                                            
                                                            Underscore to the participants the importance of sharing data. Many funding agencies, institutions, and publication venues around the world have policies regarding data sharing because transparency and openness are considered to be key parts of research.

  *30 minutes*   Providing Context                          Provide context by going through these steps in a country specific example and a generic example.
                                                            
                                                            Below, two examples have been provided of applications of the data lifecycle. One is a generic example, and one is a country specific example. If in Myanmar, please feel free to use the country-specific example provided. However, if implanting this curriculum outside of Myanmar, it would be helpful to provided participants with data lifecycle examples in their own countries.
                                                            
                                                            Generic Example: Digital Green, India
                                                            
                                                            The use of information and communications technology (ICT) in agricultural services is becoming increasingly common. These technologies—radio, SMS, television, video, and Internet services—have the potential to help smallholder farmers increase their incomes by making it easier for them to learn about and adopt new farming methods, grow higher-value crops, or connect with new markets.
                                                            
                                                            Digital Green, an international non-profit organization based in India, uses locally-produced videos and in-person facilitation to share knowledge about improved agricultural and nutrition practices. The program aims to help rural communities across South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa understand and adopt better agricultural and nutrition practices, and the ultimate goal of the program is to have a positive impact on individual well-being. Digital Green is currently working in nine states in India, and also in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Ghana, Niger, Tanzania, Malawi, and Papua New Guinea. Since its start in 2008, Digital Green’s program has produced over 4,000 videos reaching more than 800,000 viewers across more than 9,000 villages.
                                                            
                                                            Digital Green is in the process of measuring the program’s impact on farmer livelihoods and health status using evaluations in both India and Ethiopia and its effect on improving nutrition-related behaviors in India. The organization has also invested in an activity monitoring system that reports data on program implementation and tracks the adoption of Digital Green-promoted practices from remote locations. One challenge in the activity monitoring system is its reliance on data from partner organizations, which varies in quality. Recognizing the issue, Digital Green has instituted a series of data quality checks and procedures to improve quality. The Goldilocks Initiative’s recommendations for Digital Green focus on its agricultural activities, and include refining and consolidating the program’s theory of change and conducting a systematic review of data quality. *(Innovations for Poverty Action Lab, 2016)*
                                                            
                                                            Myanmar Specific Example: MIMU 3W
                                                            
                                                            In 2008, after Cyclone Nargis, the Myanmar Information Management Unit (MIMU) launched their 3W project to track and share humanitarian and development activities undertaken by all agencies across Myanmar.
                                                            
                                                            3W stands for “Who does What, Where.” By keeping an up to date database on which organizations (who) are conducting certain activities (what) in Myanmar (where), other organizations and donors can better target beneficiaries to ensure humanitarian and development needs are met.
                                                            
                                                            The partnered agencies share their information on planned, ongoing, and recently completed activities every six months using standard sector definitions and MIMU compiles these data. They clean and digitize the data, creating quality baseline data sets on humanitarian and development efforts in Myanmar and on responding agencies in the country. They then make the data publically available for other agencies to use. The intended impact is that agencies and donors can use these data to determine which areas, sectors, and populations to target in their future projects.

                                                            After each example, take time for discussion with the participants regarding data life cycles. Some guiding discussion questions include: What was the problem the organization was trying to solve? How did the organization collect data? How did they plan to analyze data? How will the use data to make a decision? How can the organization share their data? How does the organization question their data quality?

Then, provide them with the following simplified definitions:
                                                                                  
                                                                                  -   Primary data: information collected by you or your team.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  -   Secondary data: information that is collected by a third party.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  Take time to discuss with the class the benefits and drawbacks of each. Primary data are valuable in that you have control over the collection of the data and direct knowledge of the data have been managed. Take the time to walk the class through primary research’s different forms using this chart, which could be projected on the screen or passed around. *(Source: Parab, 2013)*

If they collection primary data, what were the benefits of that? What were the disadvantages? What about the benefits and disadvantages of using secondary data for a project?

  []{#_gjdgxs .anchor}   Introducing key concepts                                 A key part of any data collection plan are data collection protocols. Ask the class what a protocol is. Once they have provided their own definitions, ask the class what they think a data collection protocol might be. Then, provide the following definitions:

Solicit the participants for their own definition of metadata, then provide the follow:

Metadata can also be called data about data, or information about information. (National Information Standards Organization, 2013)

  *15 minutes*           Key considerations in designing a data collection plan   There are key questions that should be considered when designing any data management plan. Walk through the below questions with the class:
                                                                                  
                                                                                  What questions are trying to be answered?
                                                                                  
                                                                                  -   The first step to collecting data are to clearly understand the problem. Write down a set of questions and potential ways they can be answered with new or existing data
                                                                                  
                                                                                  When to collect new data (primary),and when to use existing data (secondary)?

                                                                                  What documentation will be needed to use the data again?
                                                                                  
                                                                                  -   This should tell the history of the data. Who created it? When was it created? Why was it created? What information does it include?
                                                                                  
                                                                                  Project this image on the screen or pass it around to the participants. State that this image can help provide a helpful guide in the future when designing data collection protocols Walk through the steps with the participants, taking time for discussion. If possible, have a student volunteer a problem they would like to see solved with data from the “telephone” activity. Then, walk through the steps with the class. Pause and answer any questions.

  *20 minutes*           Providing future resources                               The following section of this module provides participants with sample resources surrounding data management and collection that they can return to in the future. If using a projector, take time to go to each website and click around, providing commentary with participants about the website’s purpose and how they can use the website in the future. If not, provide screen shots of each source that can be passed around to the participants as the instructor describes each data resource.
