*(Adapted from:
<https://www.databasic.io/en/wtfcsv/wtfcsv-activity-guide.pdf> )*

**Objectives:**

-   Apply data analysis to a simplified dataset

-   Learn how to ask a dataset questions based on its content

-   Understand the importance of inspecting data for data reliability

-   Think critically about how to supplement your data with other data
    sources if necessary

**Total anticipated time: 25 mins**

**Materials Needed:**

-   Paper

-   Pencils

-   UFO dataset

-   Projector

-   Computer

**Introduction: (Use the following information to introduce and explain
the activity to the class)**

This activity focuses on data reliability, question asking, and
combining different data sources. Introduce the dataset to the class by
projecting it on the screen and go over its contents together. What
information is in the data set? What could be part of its metadata?

Then, pass out copies of the dataset and put the participants into
groups of 2-3. Have the participants inspect the dataset and answer the
following questions on their pieces of paper:

-   What is the most interesting question you want to ask the dataset
    you are looking at?

-   Do you need any other datasets to answer this question?

-   How could you get the other data you need to answer this question?

Afterwards, provide a space for discussion and debrief surround the
activity. Questions include:

-   Are all the answers to your questions contained in the dataset?

-   Where are the data from? If the sources of the data aren’t revealed,
    you should be skeptical.

-   Do you see places where values are missing? Mission values are one
    way data can be “messy.” If the class is unfamiliar with the term
    messy data, take the time to define it.

-   The data that was given to class is aggregated summary data, but
    sometimes you can ask interesting questions about just one row in a
    dataset, or look for an “outlier”. Are there any “outliers” in the
    dataset? If the class Is unfamiliar with “outliers”, provide a
    definition for them.
